## Breathing robot
**"How Do We Want to Live Together?"** *-> Mesh Festival*

Front door / entry space Metaphor for the collective choices we must make to live better together:

- Threshold/limit between the intimate and the outside world
- Choices we must make to improve our way of living.
- A call for slowness/gentleness in how we approach life.
- Welcoming only what is necessary for a balanced and sustainable future.
- A symbolic space of transition between the collective and the individual.
- Collaboration to improve our shared experiences and environment.
- Regulating what comes in and goes out, much like regulating what should be produced and consumed.

**Soft Robot Connected to This Idea:**

- **Breathing:**
   - Slow, steady breathing.
   - Breathing interrupted when there is noise or a doorbell rings.
- **Simplicity:**
   - A minimalist design that evokes calm and reflection.
- **Encouraging reflection on what we choose to let in**, whether it be into our homes or into our lives.


This robot would be an invitation to take a little time, during the transition between outside and inside, to breathe consciously. Breathing as a way to calm ourselves down. Center ourselves. 

The interaction time would depend on the energy of the user. The robot would be able to analyze the breath of the user, then would breathe at a similar pace, but a bit slower. The goal of the robot is to make your breath slow down progressively. It would stop at a point where it thinks you are ok to be welcomed. 

Trigger : someone entering the space from outside
Input : breath detection
Output : breath mouvement / pace

The robot could also be changing color if it is breathing with someone or not

To push the robot a bit further, it could be breathing all time. But when he detects some nervous activity in the house, you would see it stop breathing -> holding its breath. It could be noticable if the robot changes color with the breathing, or if it makes a breathing sound ?
