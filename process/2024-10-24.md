### To take care, to pay attention, and to act, together.

**The things that unite us as humans (ChatGPT 4o):**

- **Emotions**: Joy, sadness, fear, anger, and love are emotions shared by all, regardless of external differences. They are natural responses to human experiences and connect us to one another.
- **The need for belonging**: Human beings need to feel accepted, to belong to a group, whether it’s family, friends, or a community. This desire for social connection and belonging is a universal commonality.
- **Curiosity and exploration**: The drive to understand, to discover the world, and to ask questions is inherent to human nature. It transcends cultures and societies.
- **The need for safety and protection**: All humans seek to protect themselves physically and emotionally, to ensure their own well-being and that of their loved ones.
- **Empathy**: The ability to put ourselves in others' shoes, to understand and share their feelings, is a fundamental human trait that exists across all cultures.
- **The pursuit of happiness and meaning**: Everyone seeks to give meaning to their life, whether through relationships, experiences, or beliefs.
- **Mortality**: The awareness of death is another unifying factor. It transcends differences and reminds us of our shared human condition.
- **Creativity and artistic expression**: The need to express oneself, to create, to invent exists in every culture. Art, music, and dance are universal forms of human communication.
- **Rites of passage**: Birth, growth, aging, and death are life stages that everyone goes through, often accompanied by rites, celebrations, or universal moments of reflection.
  
## New Ideas
### Bull's-eye window
Something that comes out of the door like a tentacle with an eye at the end, analyzing you, circling around you, to give the person inside a diverse set of perspectives about you.
This also fits into the context of boundaries → we will probably infringe on the personal boundaries of the person behind the door, as if to level things right from the start, assuming that the person entering will also cross some boundaries of the host.

### Storyteller
A robot that doesn’t let you enter if you haven’t given it something: something you noticed today or something you learned today.

→ Then, it lets you in.

→ At the end of the day, it will do something to put all the observations/lessons together and create something unique from them.

→ This forces you to pay attention during your day + it brings people together because there’s a moment of sharing, which could perhaps spark the beginnings of a conversation.

INPUT = letters, words, phrases (voice, written, ~~digital~~).

OUTPUT = a letter with all the stories, a narrated story or a drawing incorporating the elements.
