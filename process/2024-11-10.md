## Collection of robots
- From outside to inside: transition from outside to inside
- Inside: transition from entrance area to living area

How can a collection of robots have a role in your passage from outside to inside ?
What about the transition between inside and outside ?

### Interactions between robots
What would they tell to each other ?
How do they communicate ?
Is the user aware of the communication between the robots ?

1. Person coming -> passing by the front door (yes/no)
2. Person from home or guest (yes/no)
3. Door opening mood (chart of the handle movement)
4. Writing story, chart, other? about the different welcomes and entries of the day?


### Roles of the robots 
- Welcoming?
- Open door?
- Make people feel awkward?
- Make people feel at home?
- Make people be more together?

### Caracteritics of the robots
- Unpredictable
- Evolving shape
- Evolving behaviour

## New idea

- **Various Sensor Robots**: Most robots serve as sensors.
- **Main Robot**: The primary robot actively interacts with the environment by opening the front door.

### Concept of the Front Door Opening

- **Invitation to open the door more frequently**:
    - Being more open to the outside world.
    - Encourages people to avoid constant self-isolation.

### The Door Robot

- **Positioned by the Door Handle**:
    - Has the physical capability to open the door.
    - Receives signals from the other robots
    - Has to decide to open or not.

### Indoor and Outdoor Interaction

- **When Should the Door Open?**:
    - When someone arrives home.
    - When someone leaves.
    - When guests arrive.
    - When the door hasnâ€™t been opened in a long time.
    - During a conflict:
        - Could open to relieve tension.
        - Or lock if leaving seems like avoidance.

### Sensors

- **Time Sensor**:
    - Tracks time, resets when the door is opened.
- **Mood Sensor**:
    - Detects sounds, interprets the emotional environment.
- **Presence Sensor**:
    - Located near the door's eye.
    - Detects movement, senses presence both inside and outside.
