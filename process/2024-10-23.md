## Research around guests
The invitation
- The art of inviting or being invited
- Collaborative design
- The host-guest relationship
- In what context do hosts and guests meet?

Films 
Le diner de con -> see how people are welcomed -> what kind of characters are present / what kind of guests are they

[Clair de lune (recueil, 1884)/Apparition - Guy de Maupassant](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Clair_de_lune_(recueil,_1884)/Apparition)

**Notes:**
- Going into another's home without him/her 
- The privilege of entering (having the right to enter)
- Difficulty or not in opening a door
- First thing you notice when entering: the light and the smells
- “dead rooms"
- Unexpected guest
- Ghost?
- “a soft, painful voice that rattled the nerves”.
- Guest frightened because the host has some kind of unconscious “power”?
- “I rushed to the door by which this being had left. I found it closed and unshakeable.”
- Closed door: confinement 
- “a fever of flight invaded me”.
- Departure or flight? -> see the definition of these words
