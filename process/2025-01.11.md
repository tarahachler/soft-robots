## Text developement for final prototype

Personality chosen for the final prototype : Sasha Loquace

### ChatGPT 4.o prompt: 

I'd like you to give me a text, divided into 4 chapters. Each chapter should be between 1000 and 1500 characters long (without spaces). This text represents what a character expresses. Here's the character description: 

Sasha Loquace - Chatterbox
Always ready to drop the most useless, outdated fun facts - usually with exact dates no one asked for. The kind of friend you grow weirdly attached to, despite knowing you'll get random trivia about 18th-century spoons mid-conversation.

I'd like you to start with sasha just saying, hello, I'm sasha, nice to meet you, then have him say lots of quick useless fun facts, starting like this: did you know that..., and ending with “isn't that great?

The fun facts should flow together, and not take up too many characters to describe. Add a tab after each fun fact, as if it were a list.

First chapter is about zany statistics
Second about creation date for everyday items
Third about unexpected scientific discoveries
And last one about absurd laws

---

After some refinements, here is the final text that will be printed : 

Chapter 1: Zany Statistics

Hello, I’m Sasha, nice to meet you! Did you know that...
There are more possible ways to shuffle a deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth? That’s 52 factorial—a number with 68 digits!       Your chances of being struck by lightning in a year are roughly 1 in 1.2 million, but those odds increase significantly if you live in Florida.       7% of Americans believe chocolate milk comes from brown cows. That’s about 16.4 million people!       Humans blink around 28,800 times a day, which adds up to about 10.5 million blinks per year.       If you folded a piece of paper 42 times, it would theoretically reach the Moon. The math checks out—isn’t that wild?       Statistically, vending machines kill more people annually than sharks. Watch out for those snacks!       Around 3% of the ice in Antarctic glaciers is composed of penguin urine. It’s all part of the water cycle!       The average person will walk the equivalent of five times around the Earth in their lifetime. Isn’t that great?

Chapter 2: Creation Dates for Everyday Items

Did you know that...
The first pair of sunglasses was invented in China in the 12th century, originally to hide judges’ facial expressions during trials?       Bubble wrap was created in 1957, but it was initially intended to be wallpaper. Imagine decorating your house with poppable walls!       The modern pencil eraser was patented in 1858 by an American named Hyman Lipman. Before that, people used bread crumbs.       Velcro was invented in 1941 by a Swiss engineer inspired by burrs sticking to his dog’s fur.       The zipper was patented in 1913, but it didn’t become widely used until the 1930s.       Toothpaste as we know it—in tubes—was first introduced in 1892. Before that, people used powders or pastes in jars.       The shopping cart debuted in 1937, and it took a while to catch on because shoppers were reluctant to use them. Isn’t that great?

Chapter 3: Unexpected Scientific Discoveries

Did you know that...
Penicillin was discovered by accident in 1928 when Alexander Fleming noticed mold killing bacteria in his lab.       Microwave ovens exist because a researcher noticed a melted chocolate bar in his pocket while working with radar in 1945.       Bananas are naturally radioactive because of their potassium content, but don’t worry—you’d need to eat 10 million in one sitting to get radiation sickness.       A sloth takes two weeks to digest a meal because of its incredibly slow metabolism.       Water bears (tardigrades) can survive in space, boiling water, and freezing conditions—essentially anywhere.       The Eiffel Tower grows by about six inches in summer due to thermal expansion. Isn’t that great?

Chapter 4: Absurd Laws

Did you know that...
In Switzerland, it’s illegal to own just one guinea pig because they get lonely without a friend.       In Oklahoma, it’s against the law to wrestle a bear. Fair enough, I guess?       In Florida, unmarried women who parachute on Sundays can be fined. That one’s thankfully not enforced anymore.       In Victoria, Australia, it’s illegal to change a lightbulb unless you’re a licensed electrician.       In Japan, there’s a law that requires companies to measure their employees’ waistlines. It’s part of an anti-obesity campaign.       In France, it’s illegal to name a pig “Napoleon” out of respect for the historic leader.       In California, it’s illegal to eat a frog that died in a frog-jumping competition. Isn’t that great?

## Text development for the other personalities

### Morphée Ombrelune
Chapter 1: The Rules of Sleep

You WOKE ME UP… Bravo. Another one of your achievements.    Now I’m up, THANKS. Want to share your adventures while we’re at it?    Are you SERIOUS coming in like that? Like you live alone or something?  Do you even THINK about anyone else? Or is it just you and the door in your world?  There are people SLEEPING here, you know. Normal people.    You could at least spare the door. What did it ever do to deserve this? SHOES. Seriously. Must you stomp through the place like an elephant?    Do you think this is a nightclub? All that noise for a door?    Every single time you come in, it’s like a storm.   Ever heard of being discreet?   Just once, I’d love it if you came in without shaking the walls. Just once.

Chapter 2: The Wrath of the Awakened

Oh, it’s you again. YOU WOKE ME UP. AGAIN.  Do you realize the door isn’t a gong? So WHY slam it like that?     Am I dreaming, or are you seriously this loud every time?   Doors are for opening, NOT FOR SCREAMING.   SHOES. Once again. Must you make your presence known with every single step?    Now I’m wide awake, thanks. Does it bring you joy, or are you just this careless?   I can hear the door crying from the abuse. Do you do this on purpose?   Do you think the neighbors hear you too? Or is it just MY SLEEP you’re sabotaging   Honestly. THIS IS RIDICULOUS.   One more night of this, and I’m moving out. Either you or the door—one of us has to go.

### Théodore de Montaigu

Chapter 1: The Curious Stranger

Pray, good sir or madam, what manner of dwelling is this that I have stumbled upon? Who are you, and by what name may I address thee?   Is this a house of commoners or a palace of noble design?   And what strange contraption opens this door with nary a servant in sight?  Do my eyes deceive me, or are these garments you wear from a distant land?  Tell me, why does everyone here walk with such haste, as though pursued by unseen foes? Surely, I must be dreaming, for this place is unlike anything I have known.

Chapter 2: The Bewildering World

What is this sorcery that brings light without flame? Are these magic lanterns? By heavens, what is this small glowing rectangle that commands such attention?  These images that move upon the walls—are they windows to another realm?    How do these carriages outside move without horses to pull them?    Pray, what is this cacophony of sounds that emanates from these strange devices?    Who is responsible for this abundance of wires and pipes crisscrossing the house?   Surely, such marvels come at a cost—what devilry have you struck a bargain with?

Chapter 3: The Aggrieved Revolutionary

Do you mock me with your silence? Answer me, you infamous scoundrels!   How dare you ignore my inquiries, you wretched knaves?   By the honor of Montaigu, I shall not be treated as a fool!    This insolence shall not stand. Have you no manners, no decency?    Are you all cursed with the affliction of rudeness? Speak, you vile charlatans! You dare to turn your back on Théodore de Montaigu? I demand satisfaction!  You are all cowards, baseborn and unworthy of your own hearth!  I curse this house and its inhabitants. May your magic lanterns burn out and your sorcery fail!


### Emile Brouillard

Chapter 1: The Doorway Enigma

Oh, you’re here! Quick question: what has one key but opens no lock?    Come on in. If a door is slightly open, is it still a door or just shy?     Did you hear that creak? Sounds like the wood has something to say. But who’s listening?    Knock three times, no more, no less. Two knocks feel impatient, and four? That’s just showing off.  Behind this door is a mystery nobody’s solved. Want to give it a shot?      If you step through, will you go left or right? Or will the floor make the choice for you?  A door swings both ways, but only one way leads to answers. Or maybe cookies.

Chapter 2: The Hallway of Riddles

Welcome, explorer! What’s lighter than air but too heavy for a bird to carry?   You’ve crossed the threshold, but have you truly arrived?   Here’s one: if a mirror reflects light, what bounces back a shadow?     What’s quieter than a whisper but makes the loudest noise when ignored?     This hallway stretches as far as your imagination… or is that just a trick of the light?   Are you moving through the hallway, or is it moving around you?  Locked doors are old news. Have you ever met a door that locked itself out?

Chapter 3: The Puzzle of Presence

You made it! But why are you here?    What starts with no beginning, ends with no end, but is still in the middle of everything?    If you’re the one knocking, does that mean you’re the outsider?     You’re standing right here, but are you sure you’re not somewhere else?   If I hand you a key, will you use it, or will it use you?     What’s in a name if it keeps changing? Maybe yours just did.    So tell me, was it my riddles that brought you here, or the silence they left behind?
